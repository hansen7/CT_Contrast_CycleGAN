# CT_Contrast_CycleGAN
This repo contain code that use CycleGAN to convert CT with contrast to CT without contrast.

It is used to incorporate the [NCCID](https://nhsx.github.io/covid-chest-imaging-database/index.html) dataset in our [Federate Diagnosis Model fo COVID-19](https://github.com/HUST-EIC-AI-LAB/COVID-19-Fedrated-Learning-Framework)
